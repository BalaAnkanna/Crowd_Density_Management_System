# Crowd Density Management System

## 📌 Project Overview
The Crowd Density Management System is a computer vision-based project designed to monitor and analyze crowd density in real-time using video input. The system detects people in a frame, calculates crowd density levels, and helps in identifying overcrowded areas to ensure safety and proper management.

This project can be used in:
- Public events
- Railway stations
- Airports
- Malls
- Smart city monitoring systems

## 🎯 Objectives
- Detect people in live video or recorded footage
- Count the number of individuals in a given area
- Analyze crowd density levels
- Indicate overcrowding situations
- Improve public safety and crowd control

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Machine Learning / Deep Learning (if used: YOLO / Haar Cascade)
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. Capture video input (webcam or video file)
2. Detect humans in each frame
3. Count the number of detected people
4. Calculate crowd density
5. Display alerts if density exceeds threshold
